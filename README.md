# **HydroLink Plus 💧🔗**

**Smart Water Metering System for a Sustainable Future 🌎**

HydroLink Plus is an IoT and AI-powered smart water metering system designed to transform traditional water management practices. Our system provides a comprehensive solution for efficient water usage monitoring, leak detection, water quality monitoring, and automated billing.

**Graduation Project 🎓**

HydroLink Plus is our main project for graduation, developed by a team of four students from the Computer Science and Engineering department.

**Monorepo Structure 🗂️**

This repository is a monorepo, containing all the necessary codes and files for the HydroLink Plus system. The repository is structured as follows:

- ReactNative App (consumer level): `mobile-app`
- Admin Level Dashboard (Next.js): `admin-dashboard`
- Authority Backend (Laravel): `authority-backend`
- ESP32 Firmware: `esp32-firmware`
- Rest API for Data Management (Laravel): `data-management-api`
- FastAPI (AI Features API): `ai-features-api`
- Schematics for PCB: `pcb-schematics`
- 3D Casing Models: `3d-casing-models`
